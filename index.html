    <p>A West African dish of rice cooked in a sauce of tomatoes and onions seasoned usually with  <br>garlic, thyme, hot pepper, and other spices and often accompanied by meat, fish, or vegetables</br>
      jollof rice, one of West Africa's beloved dishes and a common meal across Nigeria.
      Jollof rice <br> unites nearly all of West Africa, with perhaps Nigeria and Ghana being the two countries best</br> known for it. It is to West Africa what jambalaya is to Louisiana: a dish that is not just food but <br>a cultural emblem.
      Jollof rice is a one-pot rice dish consisting of fried and stewed tomatoes as <br>its flavor base. The rice is a deep red in color once finished, and can either be served as an <br>accompaniment to other Nigerian dishes or on its own alongside some plantains.</br>
    <p>Jollof Rice is so popular across Africa that it has even sparked a friendly rivalry known as <br>the “Jollof Wars,” where countries debate over who makes the best version. Nigerian Jollof <br> is famous for its rich flavor, deep color, and slight smoky taste from steaming the rice. <br>
      Whether you are enjoying it with fried plantain, grilled chicken, or salad, Jollof Rice is <br> a meal that brings people together and always leaves you wanting more.
